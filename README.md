## Dataset Description
The dataset "Top Spotify Songs" contains information about the most streamed songs on Spotify. It includes various attributes such as song title, artist name, album, release year, genre, duration, popularity score, and streaming count. The data provides insights into music trends, popular artists, and listener preferences over time. I chose this dataset because I enjoy music and find it interesting to analyze trends in popular songs.

## Data Protection and Privacy Considerations
This dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data. All information is publicly available through Spotify’s streaming charts. However, to ensure compliance with data protection regulations, any additional data processing should respect copyright laws and Spotify’s terms of use. If user-generated data were involved, anonymization techniques would be required to maintain privacy standards.
